# flyweight-design-pattern
Our project is about creating a library for books using the flyweight- design- pattern.
The flyweight design pattern provides methods for reducing object count and thus improving application execution. When we need to create a large number of similar objects, we use the flyweight pattern. The fact that flyweight objects are immutable is an important feature. This means that they cannot be altered once they have been built. 
This method can reduce the memory usage.
We created this application through JavaFX and SceneBuilder. 
We implemented it with eclipse IDE.
Inside the application, we have four options.
The interface is the main window of the application in which we can add a book to the library, add a note and check the books and notes added.
Adding a book/note:
We added a book into the library by using an observable list and an external file.
Checking the books/notes:
We viewed the available books using the same external file, a list and an iterator.
We also provided a login button before entering the application for privacy reasons, as well as a settings option.
All the codes and files that we created are provided in the repository.
to run the executable files.
